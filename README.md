Introduction
This project aims to predict life expectancy using a dataset containing various health, demographic, and socio-economic indicators. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can build a predictive model to estimate life expectancy based on these factors. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Project Overview
-Objectives
1) Understand the relationship between different features and life expectancy.
2) Build a predictive model to estimate life expectancy.
3) Evaluate the performance of the model and interpret the results.
-Methodology
1) Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize the data.
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between features and the target variable.
3) Feature Engineering: Select relevant features for the predictive model.
4) Model Training: Train a machine learning model using the selected features.
5) Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations.
